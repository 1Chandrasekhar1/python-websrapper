Scrap data from bitkeys.work

This is made for fun and use it responsibly

Python3 or higher

 -  Code Grabs BTC address and balance on every page from 0 to 500.000+ on bitkeys.works
 -  Also grabs random generated private key and its balance on the same page and sends mail if the random balance is bigger than 0 
 -  If random generated private key and its balance is bigger than 0 it also writes it on the dat.txt
 -  Writes all grabbed data on a csv file including random generated private keys and their balances

Any tips appreciated
